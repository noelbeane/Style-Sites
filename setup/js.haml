-#  The named variable (@jQuery, @MooTools, etcâ€¦) should be replaced with the version number you'd like to use. This will pull in from Google's CDN
-#  If you'd like to include a fallback if Google's CDN isn't available, change the related Fallback variable to the name of the file locally (for instance, if you had jquery-1.6-min.js, write jquery-1.6-min). Wrap in quotes. Place the fallback file inside of js/libs
-#  The code to include jQuery UI will only be written if you also include a version of jQuery
-# If you plan on using a full JavaScript library, be sure to remove Chibi from the list of Custom JS.
